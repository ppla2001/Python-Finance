Arima Time series model -> No funciona well con historical stock data or secutities data
but works well with for example trying to predict how many sales will a store produce during the summer or winter 
financial data doesn't work well with financial data

ARMIA -> AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, generalization of AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA)

Both models are fitted in time series data for forecast

Types of Arima models 
Non seasonal Arima and seasonal Arima

Non sasonnal Arima generally denoted as ARIMA(p,d,q) where p,d,q are non-negative integers (leer q son en powerpoint)
